                <span id="message"><p>Mann Co. Review website was a project that started out long ago. Sometime around the mid 2010s where it began as a school project in Temasek Polytechnic. After realising the need for such review sites to be catered to the gaming world. This site was thus built from scratch where it holds hot games that are sorted out into their categories, their genres and such.</p>
				<p>As a result, we believe that when it comes to game review sites, readability and simplicity is key. Nonetheless, we also think that when it comes to aesthetics, there must be a type of design that will appeal to people, the community and such. </p><p>This is why we adopt a minimalistic approach to this. Through inspiration from Ikea, the most iconic furniture site in the world and game review sites, Mann Co. Review website was thus developed with simplicity and minimalistically. We believe that by doing so, our welcomed and beloved guests; you, will be welcomed to our website and feel the ease in navigating around.</p>
				<p>This site has came a long way from its development and there is indeed, more room for improvement. Nevertheless, we hope that you will enjoy this website and happy commenting games on Mann Co. Review!</p>
